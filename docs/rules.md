#Rules
Like many servers, we have rules in place to keep things in order. Still, screw you Mojang for enforcing your “community standards” on our private servers - we were allowed to govern our own servers for 10 years and that’s what we want to continue

Bans from the Discord server will revoke your access to the Minecraft server.

## Platform Terms
Follow Discord’s [Terms of Service](https://dis.gd/tos) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)  
Also be aware of Minecraft’s [EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) - offline mode players are not allowed to log in due to security risks and potential abuse and pay-to-win material is prohibited.

## Discussion and Etiquette
Profanity is allowed in Minecraft and Discord chats, as long as no offensive/targeted slurs are used. This community is a safe space for everyone, including LGBTQ+, different races, religions and disabilities, etc. You are all important to us.

When someone is uncomfortable with a discussion, your best bet is to shift the subject over to something lighter

## Content Policy
This server does not allow the distribution of NSFW, NSFL or any similar content that may not be safe to watch within the Discord and Minecraft game. Sexual innuendos are fine, but anything beyond it or graphic aren’t allowed here

## In-Game Activity
The above rules apply to the Minecraft game server, and Discord bans are reflected onto it. There’s just a few things we need to address about in-game activity:
Building contraptions such as lag machines with the intent to strain or crash the server or disrupt gameplay for others is not allowed
“Griefing” - deliberately destroying others’ buildings or stealing items without consent and with the intent to harm other players is also prohibited.
