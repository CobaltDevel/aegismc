# How to Play

Here is a tutorial on how to gain access and play on the server. For information and requirements needed to join, see [this page](/info/server)

!!! warning
    If you intend to play on both Java AND Bedrock Editions, please follow the instructions [here](https://link.geysermc.org/method/online) to link your platform accounts, otherwise Discord link conflicts may happen

- Join our Discord server by clicking on the Discord footer icon

- Connect to the server with your Minecraft client. You should receive a linking code, which we're going to use next

- Send a direct message to the Aegis Bot from Discord containing just that code. 

- You should be ready to play! Connect to the server again and you'll have access!

## Extra Instructions for Console Players

Bedrock Console players cannot access the server by conventional means, but here are some specific workarounds:

### LAN Games Workaround

This workaround is guaranteed to work on PlayStation consoles  
You'll need a mobile device with you for this

- Download [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smokiem.mcserverconnector) app for Android or [this](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bedrocktogether/id1534593376) app for iOS devices.

- Input the server address and port as detailed [here](/info/server) into the boxes and click `Run` (iOS) or `Start Server` (Android)

- Launch Minecraft on your console and go to the 'Friends' tab on the menu

- You should see the the server MOTD listed under the LAN Games section - go for it!

- If you haven't already, link your Discord account as detailed above

- Done!

### BedrockConnect (DNS Workaround)

Here is an alternative workaround, as the above may not work on Xbox/Switch consoles:

#### Xbox

- Open your Xbox's settings menu

- Go to Network Settings => Advanced Settings => DNS Settings

- Change your DNS from automatic to manual - you can now enter your own IP addresses for DNS servers

- For the Primary IPv4 DNS, enter `104.238.130.180`  
For the Secondary enter `8.8.8.8` or `1.1.1.1`

- Save the changes and perform a connection test

#### Nintendo Switch

The ordeal is similar for Switch consoles, but there's a couple of extra steps:

- Launch Minecraft and log out of your account - then close it.

- Go to your Switch's system settings.

- Go to 'Internet Settings', choose your connected network and click 'Change Settings'

- Scroll down to 'DNS Settings' and change it to Manual

- Enter the same IP addresses as for Xbox, `104.238.130.180` for primary and either `8.8.8.8` or `1.1.1.1` for secondary.

Connecting to the server is a bit different if you've used the BedrockConnect method on an Xbox/Switch console:

- Launch Minecraft - if you're on Switch, log back in to your account.

- Join one of the featured servers - a menu will appear

- Click on the Connect to a Server option at the top of the list

- Enter the server address and port as detailed [here](/info/server)

- Check the 'Add to server list' button to add it to your list, then click 'Submit' to join
