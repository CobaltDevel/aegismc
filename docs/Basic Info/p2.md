# How to Play

If you have both Java and Bedrock editions (which is always for PC players), you MUST follow the instructions here before proceeding to Discord linking

The server uses Discord account synchronisation as a method of whitelisting players - just connect to the Minecraft server for the first time and DM the Aegis Bot the 4-digit code to link your account

## Bedrock Join Instructions
In order to join the server on PlayStation/Xbox versions of Minecraft, you’ll need a mobile device on you. Install this app for iOS or this app for Android

If you also play Java Edition, make sure you’ve done the Geyser global link procedure - under the above header

Open the app and input the server address listed above and 25645 as the port. Start the LAN server.

Log in to Minecraft on your console and go to Friends - the server should appear under LAN Games, go ahead and join it! If you haven’t already, link your Discord account before you play.

There is a DNS workaround that allows Nintendo Switch players to join custom servers, a tutorial can be found here - the server address and port are the same as above.

For PC/Mobile Bedrock players, just enter the server address and port into the Add External Server dialogue and you’re off!
